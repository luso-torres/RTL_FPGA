# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized...
# ** Warning: (vopt-10587) Some optimizations are turned off because the +acc switch is in effect. This will cause your simulation to run slowly. Please use -access/-debug to maintain needed visibility. The +acc switch would be deprecated in a future release.
# ** Note: (vsim-12126) Error and warning message counts have been restored: Errors=0, Warnings=1.
